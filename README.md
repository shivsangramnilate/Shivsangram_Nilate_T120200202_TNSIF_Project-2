🏭 Manufacturing Output Prediction – Streamlit App

A lightweight machine learning project designed to predict the hourly manufacturing output (Parts Per Hour) of injection molding machines. The system uses a Linear Regression model (SGD Regressor) trained on key machine parameters to estimate real-time production efficiency.

🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on forecasting production output in injection molding environments using operational parameters such as:

Melt temperature

Injection pressure

Holding pressure

Cooling time

Cycle time

Screw speed

And other machine-level settings


By analyzing these parameters, the model provides accurate hourly output predictions that support operators and supervisors in making informed production decisions.
