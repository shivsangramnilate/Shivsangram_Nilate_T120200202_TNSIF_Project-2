# Manufacturing Streamlit App

A simple machine learning project that predicts the hourly manufacturing output (Parts Per Hour) of injection molding machines.
The model uses Linear Regression (SGD) and takes machine parameters such as temperature, pressure, cycle time, and other operational settings to provide accurate output predictions.
The project also includes a Streamlit web app for real-time production forecasting and operator decision support.
